# Blockchain Evidence Management System

Managing digital forensic evidence with integrity and accountability is critical in law enforcement and legal proceedings. This project proposes a web-based system that ensures the traceability and tamper-evident storage of forensic evidence using blockchain principles.

The system allows investigators to upload, track, and retrieve digital files while maintaining a secure chain of custody. Although it does not implement a full decentralized blockchain, it utilizes cryptographic hashing, timestamping, and audit trails to simulate the core properties of blockchain technology within a Django web application.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Evidence Submission**  
   Investigators upload forensic files through a secure web interface. Each file is hashed using SHA256 to generate a unique digital fingerprint.

2. **Hash Chain Ledger**  
   Each uploaded file is timestamped and linked to the previous record, mimicking a blockchain-like chain. This creates a verifiable trail of actions without using a distributed network.

3. **Tamper Detection**  
   Any changes to evidence files or metadata break the hash sequence, triggering an alert that the file may have been tampered with.

4. **Audit & Reporting**  
   The system logs every activity (upload, access, hash verification) and allows administrators to generate detailed audit reports.

5. **Authentication & Roles**  
   Different user roles (Admin, Investigator) control access and ensure accountability for each action performed on the evidence.
